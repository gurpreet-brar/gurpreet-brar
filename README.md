## 👋 Hi, I'm Gurpreet Brar

**About me**

I'm a passionate **full-stack web developer** who recently completed an intensive software development bootcamp. I love turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly web applications that are both functional and accessible. 

I've developed strong expertise in:

*HTML5*, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MySQL**.

My background in **Quality Assurance** combined with my recent education in **software development** enables me to think critically, test thoroughly, and build applications using a **user-centric approach**. I strive to write clean, maintainable code and continuously improve my skills through real-world projects and collaboration.


💡 I'm actively expanding my skills by learning:

- ⚛️ **TypeScript**
- 🧠 **Redux Toolkit**
- 🚀 **Next.js**
- 🔍 **GraphQL**
